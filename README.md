# Heart Disease Prediction

## Access the App

You can access the Heart Disease Prediction app [here](https://heart-disease-ml-analytics.streamlit.app/).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this app is to showcase my machine learning skills by building and evaluating a predictive model for heart disease. This includes demonstrating the use of various evaluation metrics and the importance of hyperparameter tuning in creating effective models.

## Introduction

This app predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on clinical features. By utilizing different machine learning models and evaluation metrics, the app aims to provide accurate predictions and illustrate my proficiency in machine learning techniques.

### Data

The dataset used in this app includes clinical features commonly associated with heart disease. These features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. 
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient (M = Male, F = Female)
- **ExerciseAngina**: Exercise-induced angina - Whether the patient experiences chest pain induced by exercise (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **ChestPainType**:
    - Value 1: Typical angina (standard chest pain related to the heart)
    - Value 2: Atypical angina (chest pain not typically associated with the heart)
    - Value 3: Non-anginal pain (chest pain not related to the heart)
    - Value 4: Asymptomatic (no chest pain)
- **RestingBP**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
- **FastingBS**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **RestingECG**: Resting electrocardiographic results
    - Value 0: Normal
    - Value 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (showing issues with heart waves)
    - Value 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria (Results indicating possible or definite thickening of the heart muscle)
- **MaxHeartRate**: Maximum heart rate the patient achieves during an exercise test

## App Overview

### Data Exploration
- **Overview of the dataset**: Explanation of the clinical features used in the model.
- **Data visualization**: Graphical representations of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Predictive models**: Description of the machine learning models used to predict heart disease.
- **Evaluation metrics**: Metrics used to assess the performance of the models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, and Mean Square Error.

### Heart Disease Prediction
- **Input patient data**: Enter clinical features to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Prediction results and risk level**: Display the prediction results and categorize the risk level.

## Why Predict Heart Disease?

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. Predicting heart disease allows for timely medical interventions, lifestyle changes, and continuous monitoring, which can prevent severe complications and save lives. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are responsible for approximately 31% of all global deaths.
